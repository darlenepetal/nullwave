        <p>"it's all coming full circle!"</p>
        <p>we don't remember exactly where this phrase became a "prayer."</p>
        <p>we are, all of us, however many there are that make up me, the body writing this, every part, all at once. </p>
        <p>this, me, i, we are, and i am, as all this, in the middle E seat of the 21st row of a plane on thursday, may 29, 2025, 22:08.</p>

        <p>some things are not hard, they are just bad. </p>
        <p>sometimes, hard things are more fun than easy things. </p>

        <p>this is yet another NULLWAVE CHALLENGE RUN: </p>
        <p>write about something in a limited span of time! never fails.</p>
        <p>this essay is about nothing in particular, regarding everything that is important in this moment.</p>
        <p>this essay is about music, and video games, and... well... maybe you... i dunno...</p>
        <p>this essay is about Radiator Hospital, and 13 & God, and Night Verses, and Red House Painters, and Modest Mouse.</p>
        <p>this essay is not about The Smashing Pumpkins, Macintosh Plus, James Ferraro, Linkin Park, All American Rejects, or Rites of Spring, Sunny Day Real Estate, Capp N' Jazz (I've never even listened to them yet, how could it possibly be about them), or Nine Inch Nails, and it's DEFINITELY not about Frank Turner even if it is because it has to be, or even, a good band, like Eminem</p>
        <p>fuck, i thought that was funny. hey, what's up? </p>
        <p>anyway, it's not really about video games even if it kind of is. i TRICKED you. but it's kind of about rouglikes, duh, but it's also about overwatch, it's DEFINITELY about guitar hero (even if i don't talk about it, which i might not) </p>
        <p>well, what's there to say. i had a good time. i have learned enough any yugioh to build a plunder patroll deck on paper with a light purrely engine.</p>
        <p>i needed to do this, because im researching. i am really digging into this shit! </p>
        <p>TRICKED YOU ALL ALONG:</p>

        <p>22:24. that's pretty good! </p>
        <p>hey, welcome back.</p>
        <p>babies are screaming already. it actually started right when i said "hey, welcome back."</p>
        <p>im going to turn on one of the few albums saved to my phone and we're going to talk i guess. </p>

        <p>get a clue!</p>
        <p>i don't have the albums downloaded that i will be talking about, because i came up with the idea to write this half an hour ago.</p>
        <p>doesn't this song rock? has it "dropped" for you? oh man, is this essay about vampire the masquerade bloodlines?</p>
        <img class="article-screenshot" src="/images/essay-images/big-cloud/nullbigcloud04.png" alt="vtmbl nullified artwork">
        <p>to understand this: play vampire the masquerade bloodlines for about an hour or so! that's all you really need. come back when you're done. ill wait! go ahead, actually, finish the album. you know what? set a timer for one hour. that's about how long for me to listen to the entirety of mezzanine by massive attack.</p>
        <p>oh no, is this essay gonna suck? </p>
        <p>LET'S FIND OUT!</p>
        <p>anyway, you didn't actually need to play the game, it's pretty simple, and i tricked you:</p>
        <p>angel by massive attack sounds like it would be a part of the vampire the masquerade bloodlines soundtrack</p>
        <p>products of a somewhat similar era, lacuna coil and massive attack influenced and shared a particular audience of, kind of, like, goths, at the turn of the century.....</p>
        <p>i know, right??.. clutches my long black hair </p>
        <p>?? what yeah, born in 1998. and... ???</p>
        <p>shur up... </p>
        <p>haha...</p>
        <p>there's a poster for lacuna coil in vampire the masquerade bloodlines. big reveal!</p>
        <p>you know what other video game lacuna coil is in? </p>
        <p>guitar hero iii!</p>
        <p>this essay, and once again ive tricked you, is actually about GUITAR HERO!</p>
        <p>i love guitar hero. i could talk about it all day. i played so much guitar hero with the nintendo wiitar controller, because that's what it was called</p>
        <p>what's this essay about? i guess let's start at radiator hospital. let's speak quickly in the rapid fire nebulousness of thought patterns.</p>
        <p>by the way, on an edible - yeah, thanks for noticing :?</p>
        <p>"cut your bangs" by girlpool comes on spotify radio during my bike ride to school one morning. i like it. </p>
        <p>i make a best friend, and kind of only friend, at least one year, in high school. i will be the first to say: i was a pathetically autistic mommas boy faggot in the making. i was an immature teenager. i was pretty immature as a young adult. im probably immature right now! i won't know until i look back on it. </p>
        <p>this friend told me one day: cut your bangs by girlpool is a cover of cut your bangs by radiator hospital. </p>
        <p>when i was a month from becoming 22, i flew to florida.</p>
        <p>let's not talk about THAT right now! </p>
        <p>let's talk about: how my growing-out hair was finally styled for the first time! </p>
        <p>my bangs were cut in a bathroom in florida as i listened to cut your bangs by radiator hospital.</p>
        <p>i listened to a lot of radiator hospital this week! </p>
        <p>i burned two cds for momo, because momos car has a cd player and a radio as the two methods of listening to music.</p>
        <p>momo is awesome. we listened to a lot of daft punk  and brave little abacus, and my chemical romance,erade bloodlines. big reveal!</p>

        <p>I HAVE TO PEE PISS, STOP THE TIMER, OKAY, THIS DOESN'T COUNT?</p>
        <p>hey guys. im peeing on a plane right now. what's up? why don't you respond to me when i ask you questions? </p>
        <p>man, i sure am peeing on this plane 👍 now. do you think i farted? </p>
        <p>LMAO the emoji inserted by accident!! i am typing on my phone, lol, this is so funny, anyway, im putting my pants on, shut up, one second, gosh</p>
        <p>i thought that was funny. anyway. did you actually listen to mezzanine or play vampire the masquerade bloodlines? let me know... in the comments...</p>
        <p>alright, let's talk! </p>
        <p>we learned about clouds this weekend</p>
        <p>we wrote a poem once for a person we liked that loved clouds. we thought about that poem a lot this week, because momo likes clouds!</p>
        <p>we thought of the poem again as the plane took off. overcast ohio sky stratocumulus (?) quickly became milky soft undercast. oh man, milky!! milky is an awesome cat. for those that don't know about milky:</p>
        <img class="article-screenshot" src="/images/essay-images/big-cloud/nullbigcloud03.png" alt="gankoukeikei">
        <p>get real! get a grip! check it out. that's milky. i wonder... i wonder what she will look like when she...</p>
        <p>hi momo. </p>
        <p>:) </p>
        <p>this essay is not public on the website. </p>
        <p>this essay will never be public on the website. </p>
        <p>hi momo. </p>
        <p>hi momo. </p>
        <p>gosh...</p>
        <p>that was some trip, huh? </p>
        <p>hahaha</p>
        <p>oh, don't make my cry on the plane...</p>
        <p>tricked you!!!</p>
        <p>hehehehehe tricked you</p>
        <p>got you!!</p>
        <p>CAUGHT YOU!!</p>
        <p>anyway rheyree</p>
        <p>and </p>
        <p>is it about LACUNA COIL???</p>
        <p>it's</p>
        <p>- spiral - a hole</p>
        <p>there is a hole in her heart she is trying desperately to fill</p>
        <p>tonight my blood is rich with sand and powder glass - infinitesimal glass </p>
        <p>her car, in the drive-thru</p>
        <p>13 & god </p>
        <p>night verses</p>
        <p>-----------</p>
        <p>everything after "CAUGHT YOU" and before that line was the "caboose" of the essay. this is how we write essays. we write down a bunch of notes touching on things we want to talk about, and then we expand the thoughts slowly over time. </p>
        <p>the essay grows and topics from the "bottom" of the text document becomes smaller and smaller, until the essay is over, and everything remaining in the "diaper" is thrown away. </p>
        <p>i just came up with this analogy. i think that rocked. that was my essay diaper.</p>
        <p>hey, i love you </p>
        <p>:D</p>
        <p>oh gosh maybe this essay is about nothing at all</p>

        <p>23:07...</p>

        <p>the point of this essay was originally to just catalogue our week together. we thought it would be funny to just disguise it as an essay on the website. haha, !! </p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>nap time</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>23:49</p>
        <p>that katsu was so good! it feels insanely in my tummy right now. i think now would be a good time to run the cart through if i was an airplane. i think they're loading up the cart. this is genius! im not going to get a beer on the airplane. even if that would be awesome. god, that would be so awesome. maybe i would sleep as fuck ^^</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>23:51</p>
        <p>said like momo: </p>
        <p>orange fantaaaa~!</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>23:56</p>
        <p>two babies are loudly crying in perfect unison. their mothers give a gentle shh... just like we did to momo, as we comforted it... it's okay baby, just a little quieter...</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>23:59</p>
        <p>momo can stay up past its bedtime</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>00:01</p>
        <p>god, it must have been a fucking nightmare raising a child. </p>
        <p>my mother was momo's age when she had her first, my older sister. we both must have cried like this, a lot. we probably didn't thank our mother(s?) enough for being at least somewhat patient with us. we don't remember how patient she was. we hardly remember the times we cried like this. </p>
        <p>we're glad we got to meet momo's mother. she isn't an incredible person. but she doesn't strike me as an evil woman. i had a nice time, honestly. the hotel was lovely. oh gosh, oh goodness, the BREAKFAST BEER! HAHAHA</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>rough list:</p>
        <p>talk before the flight</p>
        <p>flight</p>
        <p>studied</p>
        <p>played slay the spire</p>
        <p>won as the silent A7 and the defect A7</p>
        <p>arrived</p>
        <p>walked</p>
        <p>smiled at momo </p>
        <p>truthfully, something was off. </p>
        <p>it felt like we knew what was about to happen, but not how, or how far, just this feeling, that SOMETHING is going to happen</p>
        <p>smiled all the way to the car!! </p>
        <p>no words on tellegram, just smiles in response to momo...</p>
        <p>saw the car </p>
        <p>past pillar 9... </p>
        <p>momo gets out of the car</p>
        <p>runs around the front... </p>
        <p>"hiii momo~"</p>
        <p>asks to hug me </p>
        <p>yes</p>
        <p>big hug</p>
        <p>stare at momo</p>
        <p>for a while </p>
        <p>momo</p>
        <p>was so</p>
        <p>quiet</p>
        <p>momo was so repressed</p>
        <p>wow, momo was so quiet...</p>
        <p>we asked if momo was hungry</p>
        <p>momo said yes</p>
        <p>we asked what momo wanted</p>
        <p>momo said...</p>
        <p>hm...</p>
        <p>i know... </p>
        <p>skyline chili...</p>
        <p>we park in an alley next to a shopping cart. </p>
        <p>we walk to a skyline chili cafe.</p>
        <p>momo orders 3 chili cheese dogs.</p>
        <p>i accidentally order "chili spaghetti" with habenero cheese, because i thought 5x5 meant, a chili dog with, 5 ingredients, or something, but i guess it's, spaghetti with, chili in it, and it was... it </p>
        <p>well there was a lot of cheese</p>
        <p>anyway, honestly, wasn't bad, kinda good, ate all the leftovers, didn't shit for 3 days, maybe unrelated</p>
        <p>we run across the street to a gas station</p>
        <p>momo is so quiet but tagging along and having fun!</p>
        <p>i want a lighter for my cigarettes</p>
        <p>i see they have a six pack of this cute purple capybara cider thing... capysnacks...? it was so good... i bought it</p>
        <p>accidentally got mentol → more menthol camel crushes instead of non-menthol → menthol camel crushes</p>
        <p>get a lighter with the statue of liberty on it</p>
        <p>run back to the car</p>
        <p>momo leads the way with an incredible sense of direction and shortcuts</p>
        <p>back to the car, set the bags down in front of the shopping cart</p>
        <p>tell momo we kinda want to put momo in the shopping cart :)</p>
        <p>momo blabbers a little and brattily gets in the shopping cart...</p>
        <p>make momo record it on its phone that folds in half</p>
        <p>ride down this alley hill with momo</p>
        <p>feels special in the way it feels rudimentary and easy</p>
        <p>touch momo in the alleyway for a moment... kiss it... kiss it cheek...</p>
        <p>it pulls out a marker...</p>
        <p>draw a spiral</p>
        <p>i draw an hourglass</p>
        <p>we drive back</p>
        <p>this house i tried to find online...</p>
        <p>third floor is everyone in momo's house! this makes so much more sense</p>
        <p>throughout the night, and for a couple nights, consider the cigarette... </p>
        <p>say hi to jenna..</p>
        <p>say hi to milky....</p>
        <p>say hi to tofu...</p>
        <p>his bandaid was in momo's clothes! </p>
        <p>they're married... he has a beautiful ring </p>
        <img class="article-screenshot" src="/images/essay-images/big-cloud/nullbigcloud05.png" alt="gankoukeikei">
        <p>kiss and play </p>
        <p>momo knocks over its juice</p>
        <p>mama was making momo drink juice because its body was feeling strange </p>
        <p>momo knocks over an ice cold capysnacks... </p>
        <p>i jump to clean it up with water and a washcloth for momo ^^</p>
        <p>we brush our teeth together, like every night</p>
        <p>we kiss and fall asleep together </p>
        <p>wake up late, kiss a bunch of really gross awesome ways...</p>
        <p> make breakfast sandwiches... record inverse videos</p>
        <p>we went for a walk!</p>
        <p>we walked to a park. </p>
        <p>we found a frisbee on the way there!</p>
        <p>we played games at the playground.</p>
        <p>momo was a little quiet sweet baby chibbus boygirl child  ~~</p>
        <p>it ran the obstacle course, we tried to jump across in boots ... momo was faster! </p>
        <p>we threw the frisbee... we taught momo how to throw the frisbee. momo picked up so quick!! this was a great sign... momo was so willing to keep playing when when it was tired, and keep trying even though it kept messing up, because so was i, so was didi... and it was fun to get better at something. </p>
        <p>some things are not bad, they are just hard.  </p>
        <p>sometimes, hard things are more fun than easy things. </p>
        <p>this was a hard trip. it was amazing. it was so easy and effortless and it took so little effort on my part, just every ounce of my energy. sometimes, things that are hard are really easy, and really exhausting, but also like napping.</p>
        <p>kind of like overwatch! this essay is just like overwatch. i can't nap. my brain moves too fucking fast and i love it. i don't want to slow the fuck down. i love that momo doesn't want to slow me down, it loves enabling me... and yet, it knows when and how to get me to stop, so easily...</p>
        <p>we swang on the swings. i told one of the one hundred stories i told on this trip.</p>
        <p>momo drank water like a doggy!</p>
        <p>momo forgot its jacket. </p>
        <p>momo says</p>
        <p>didi!!!</p>
        <p>expecting momo to be heading for us </p>
        <p>no... momo is beckoning us</p>
        <p>yes momo?</p>
        <p>can we get ice cream???</p>
        <p>we don't want to keep walking all that much. we have no idea how far away it is. we really don't even want ice cream right now.</p>
        <p>hm...</p>
        <p>sure momo!!! ^^</p>
        <p>momo was onto something. the ice cream was pretty close by, and it was delicious, and we relaxed for a moment. momo brought up the cafe next door... we should try to go there, momo says... </p>
        <p>didi thinks, eh, okay, if you want! that sounds like it could be kinda nice.</p>
        <p>didi says, great idea! let's think of a day to do it :)</p>
        <p>we never thought we would do it on the last day... GOSH, im glad we did... the katsu... mmmm... </p>
        <p>we walk back. we watch a little bit of the doom review... we stop after not a lot of time</p>
        <p>gosh, what else...? did we have momo try stimulants at all that day? or was that the next day? was that the night of... the show???</p>
        <p>that was the night of the show!!! </p>
        <p>we got culvers and went to a show and momo danced really awesome. and didi hurt its neck headbanging so much at emo music. mcdonalds sprite kandi.</p>
        <p>immense amount of respect for momo achieved... it danced its heart out...</p>
        <p>the next day, we go to the grocery store, and get stuff so didi can make tacos :)) </p>
        <p>we play a game of yugioh... shitty crystal beasts vs dinosaurs....??? was that the same day...</p>
        <p>oh yes and 51 worldwide classics!!! mancala, dots and boxes, yacht dice, four in a row, toy baseball...</p>
        <p>didi makes tacos. they rock!</p>
        <p>quiz momo on my little pony...</p>
        <p>momo quizzes didi on emo music lyrics</p>
        <p>next morning... trip to michigan</p>

        <p>drive five and a half hours</p>

        <p>order for momo, no sour cream...</p>
        <p>feels so good to buy things for this little doll</p>
        <p>momos mother needed help moving some furniture into a truck</p>
        <p>didi and momo went to help </p>
        <p>and also to go to an arcade and a hotel room and buy yugioh cards</p>
        <p>check into a cute small hotel paid for by momos mother </p>
        <p>momo's mother goes off </p>
        <p>check out the room :)</p>
        <p>fuck momo's face standing up on the bed ^^</p>
        <p>we go to an arcade</p>
        <p>text momo's mom, invite her out to dinner</p>
        <p>no asteroids deluxe...</p>
        <p>but we play some pinball and a bunch of this motorcycle game and the funny car game that they have at game lab btww momo</p>
        <p>eat dinner with momos mom in a country bumpkin loud fucking tavern and i eat a BIG burger</p>
        <p>possibly nailed the dinner with momo's mom</p>
        <p>weird meeting my weird son's weird mother</p>
        <p>was nice though </p>

        <p>not much there...</p>
        <p>guy says they're cheaper at walmart</p>
        <p>hmm... </p>
        <p>go to walmart</p>
        <p>its more expensive and they dont have shit!</p>
        <p>ehehhe we go back to meiejrr and buy like $100 of yugioh cards and a COLLAR for momo with nullwave colours </p>
        <p>go back with a hard lemonade and play an improvised two games with our shit cards</p>
        <p>1-1!</p>
        <p>go to sleep</p>
        <p>waking up felt so strange in that place...</p>
        <p>almost like paradise...</p>
        <p>such a safe place, every place we slept </p>
        <p>high up, or tucked away</p>
        <p>tomorrow, the beach... of lake michigan...</p>
        <p>the most important day yet...</p>
        <p>each day got more and more important</p>
        <p>each day</p>
        <p>only 7 days</p>
        <p>how was it only 7 days...?</p>
        <p>momo...</p>
        <p>oh, momo...</p>
        <p>momo, we're so tired...</p>
        <p>can momo carry on the story...?</p>
        <p>can it be momo's turn...?</p>
        <p>from THIS! point forward, momo is allowed to edit the remaining text of this essay. </p>
        <p>how would we distinguish ourselves...? -didi</p>
        <p>didi: hmmm...</p>
        <p>ummm...... did says, trying to listen to momo so hard right now... </p>
        <p>but it's really hard, didi thinks, because im alone on a plane...</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>we think it would be fun if little chunks between these nine hyphens would be fun to have as individual segments of the essay, written by either didi or momo, but without saying who it was!!! you'll just have to try and catch on... or wait until we say so....</p>
        <p>- anonymous!</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>momo can slot segments in wherever it wants past that point! momo can change anything after that point. momo can make up... it's own rules! </p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>01:13</p>
        <p>nap time...</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>some things are not hard, they are just bad. </p>
        <p>sometimes, bad things are easier than good things. </p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>1:23 </p>
        <p>didi's yawn trick is working.... momo was right</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>"make the face momo makes when it realizes it's on ecstasy."</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>spiralling out, from one to the other... flowing, circling, sinking, billowing out and in, joined</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>momo was so repressed...</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>didi wrote so hard it didn't notice the cart pass by... didn't get an orange fanta....</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>gosh, well, momo really could just edit this whole thing if it wanted to... who's gonna stop momo???</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>we will teach momo how to write in this html page :) and help link it to a GitHub account momo controls...</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>momo can even delete some of these... in fact... momo should delete this one... we look forward to seeing how momo plays with this :) however it wants </p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>sad that we can't show this to momo right when we land... it'll probably be asleep anyway...</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>meanwhile, our shattering animals</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>this was fun.</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>each of these will be spoilered on telegram... we will explain it to momo!! good idea</p>
        <p>---------</p>
        <p>the plane is about to land safely. when it touches down, my words will end. did will not contribute anything else to this unless momo tells us to :)</p>
        <p>---------</p>
